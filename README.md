# NBD-Review
Files associated with Nature Biodiversity Reviews Miranda et al. 2026. ECOTOX Knowledgebase data wrangling here! 


Files includes were produced in multiple itterations of data analysis, hence multiple itterations of ggplot2 figures.
The final version used analysis and plots in the NBD invited review are in the R markdown file "INSERT NAME HERE AT A LATER DATE"
all other RMD files and csv uploads were from multiple itterations of analysis denoted as "INSERT OTHER NAMES HERE LATER"

This is my first entry on GitHub, please reach out if further clarity on these analyses is needed. All methods for analysis should be denoted in the SI section of "DOI here later".
